# Healthcare_Tableau_DataViz

This project aims to build visualizations on Tableau to find insights from a healthcare system's dataset.  The dataset contains information for patients and their visits (such as provider type, drug prescribed etc.). The focus of our analysis is to identify inefficiencies across departments in the hospital’s system.

Below are our recommendations from our analysis- 

**Recommendation 1: Redistributing workload for patients with symptoms of depression for ages under 45**

We start with providers’ inefficiencies and recommend redistributing workload for patients with symptoms of depression for ages under 45 by incentivizing ‘General/Family Practice’ over ‘Psychiatry’ to take the patients for better efficiency. Psychiatry visits take more than 50% extra time per visit compared to General/Family Practice for depression patients aged less than 45. We further broke down depression cases by day of week and discovered that Psychiatry visits for depression on Monday and Thursday take double the time per visit on average. Hence, it is important to investigate why psychiatry takes so much time on Monday and Thursday and this requires additional data.  

**Recommendation 2: Optimizing Lab processing for CVA, Bronchitis NOS, and Acute Pharyngitis**
