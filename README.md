# Healthcare_Tableau_DataViz

This project aims to build data visualization to find insights from a healthcare system's dataset.  The dataset contains information of patients and their visits (such as provider type, drug prescribed etc.). 

The focus of our analysis is to identify inefficiencies across departments in the hospitalâ€™s system. Below are our recommendations from our analysis- 

Recommendation 1: Redistributing workload for patients with symptoms of depression for ages under 45 

Recommendation 2: Optimizing Lab processing for CVA, Bronchitis NOS, and Acute Pharyngitis 

Recommendation 3: Streamlining drug prescription by diagnosis
